## About Me
I'm a soon-to-be Bachelor of Computer Science (Minor in Mathematics) and a lifelong jack-of-all-trades from [Eastern Washington University](https://www.ewu.edu/) with an insatiable hunger for knowledge and information. Over the years I've become obsessed learning all I can in as many disciplines as I find myself interested in... whether that be game engines, gasoline engines, anatomy, gorgeous views, fractals, or something in between. Always on the hunt for my next hyperfixation!

Currently, I'm a junior developer in the transport industry around [Spokane, WA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane,_Washington) (starting this June) as well as a shift manager (and driver) at my local Pizza Hut.

Interests include:
- GPU Computing
- Video Games
- Cars (JDM Especially)
- Weightlifting
- Discrete Mathematics
- Hiking
- Tech Stack Exploration
- Water Sports
- many, many more...

## Projects
My current spare-time project is a small, application specific game engine for an FPS project I'm keeping under wraps. I'm also taking this opportunity to write a few C++ libraries to use in said project. There's a handful of other personal projects I'm also working on, but between full time school and full time work, contributions and progress can be few and far between.

[Mirror](https://github.com/tremorris1999/Mirror) - The game engine no one ever asked for. ðŸ˜Ž

[MirrorModel](https://github.com/tremorris1999/MirrorModel) - Model loading library built for Mirror.

[MirrorLog](https://github.com/tremorris1999/MirrorLog) - Logging library ~~in desperate need of refactoring~~ built for use in Mirror.

[Website](https://github.com/tremorris1999/WebPortfolio) - My personal website/portfolio where I'd ideally like to showcase some of my work.
